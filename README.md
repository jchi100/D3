# D3

The task of the project is analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs and interactives to help readers understand the findings out of data.

Data sources: the 2014 one-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.  The final filtered data is saved data.csv file.  By testing for correlation with Excel's =CORREL() function. Aim for a value either less than -0.5 or more than 0.5â€”these values would indicate a moderate correlation and a story that might be worth.
Tool: Using the D3 techniques to create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 

Features: Each label on the scatter plot has click event so that the users can decide which data to display.  The transitions are animated for the circles' locations as well as the range of the x, y axes.  The tooltips attached to the circles display the data that the user has selected.
